// Java has 6 relational operators.

// == is the equality operator. This returns true if both the operands are referring to the same object, otherwise false.
// != is for non-equality operator. It returns true if both the operands are referring to the different objects, otherwise false.
// < is less than operator.
// > is greater than operator.
// <= is less than or equal to operator.
// >= is greater than or equal to operator
